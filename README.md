Tax Breakdown

➔ 2% rewards to holders

➔ 3% marketing tax

➔ 6% Buy-Back tax

➔ Slippage: 13%

Meadowbrown collects 6% Buyback tax on each transaction and maintains it under contract.

Whenever a Sell happens, a fraction of the Buyback amount is used to automatically buy from

the Liquidity Pool and burns those tokens accordingly.

There are 3 advantages:

Raise in Value

○ After the tokens from the Liquidity pool are bought, the new BNB amount is added to the pool and

the amount of the tokens are reduced, which results in an increase in price.

Free BNB

○ Once those tokens are burnt, it is like adding free BNB to the pool as there are no tokens to sell in the

future.

Trust & Reliability

○ Investors can be relentlessly hesitant, and often get spooked by a bearish market.

○ Because of the Buyback, Investors will never see more than 2 Sells at any time and 98% of the time,

they will only see one Sell as there will always be a Buy from the contract.
